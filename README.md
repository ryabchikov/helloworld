Just another helloworld repository

Hello people my name is Alexey. I work in rscc and i cant do programming almost at all. I only able to make some stupid website with stupid interface and backend. Seems like I'll never be able to make something valuable. I'm bad in English as well. Maybe if I tried some opensource python project I could increase my skills at least a little bit. I'm not to bad with networks at least. But uneversity where I got a degree so bad, so my education almost useless. Noone would read it anyway. So thank you for your attention. You people are awesome, could do programming and everything. Also at work we dont work on projects as a team and I dont know what to start with. I should stop here. Blame me that I so stupid.
